# Surface Reconstruction from Point Cloud Data using Libigl

We reconstruct smooth surfaces from the point cloud data using the RBF interpolation. We  also optimize the code for the large data sets using the center reduction technique where we can reconstruct reasonable good surfaces from large data sets just by taking a subset from the initial data set.
